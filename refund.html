              our Customers 5 days’ satisfaction period to test our product and
              another 5 days to return our product back.

              <ull>
                <li>They don’t like the product</li>

                <li>If they think that they impulsively bought the product</li>
                <li>If they believe that product is not what they ordered</li>
                <li>Or any other reason</li>

              product was purchase on 1st of March 2021 and customer shipped it
              back on 10th of march 2021 we still accept the refund. Customer
              needs to send us picture of shipment which clearly shows the
              tracking number and date. Picture should be send by emailing us at
              . Once we receive the product our customer support team will
              respond our customers by emailing back that the product was
              received as it is and has no physical damages. Along with that
              email our company will send the receipt of Refund. ( which takes 5

              notified before the charge is made, either by Text message and or
              by email. We will not charge our customer before the services are
              delivered and they are happy with our services. Once our customers

              charge the customer. After the customer is charged for the
              services we offer 30 days 100% refund policy in following
              scenario.
            </p>

              done. In that case we don’t have a policy where we refund our
              customers but as a reputable company if customer has same issue

              to fix the issue. Neither the product will be provided by
              technicians nor will be sold by our company. The customer has to
              buy the product and provide to the technicians who will help our
              customers to resolve the issue.
