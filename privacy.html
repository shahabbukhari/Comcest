            <p class="mb-5">
              As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this
              site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to
              your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes
              what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes
              need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can
              prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade
              or ‘break’ certain element of the sites functionality.

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">HOW WE USE COOKIES</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
              We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
              Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry standard
              options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
              functionality and features they add to this site. It is
              recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
              whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
              service that you use.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">DISABLING COOKIES</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
              You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings
              on your browser (see your browser Help to know how to do it). Be
              aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this
              and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will
              usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
              features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not
              disable cookies.

              If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the
              management of the signup process and general administration. These
              cookies will usually be deleted when you log out however in some

              when logged out.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this
              fact. This prevents you from having to log in every single time
              you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or
              cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access
              restricted features and areas when logged in.

              From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to
              provide you with interesting insights, helpful tools, or to
              understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use
              cookies to remember who has already taken part in a survey or to

            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">
              As we sell products it’s important for us to understand statistics
              about how many of the visitors to our site actually make a

              This is important to you as it means that we can accurately make
